# CLI To-Do List Application

📝 To-Do List Manager (C++)

This is a simple command-line To-Do List Manager built using C++. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features like adding, updating, removing, and listing tasks. The tasks are saved in a file (tasks.txt), ensuring that data persists even after closing the program.

🚀 Features
✅ Add Tasks – Easily add new tasks to your list.
✅ Remove Tasks – Delete completed or unnecessary tasks.
✅ Update Tasks – Modify existing tasks.
✅ List Tasks – View all pending and completed tasks.
✅ Task Persistence – Saves tasks in a file (tasks.txt) for future use.
✅ Colorful Console Output – Uses ANSI escape codes for better UI experience.

🛠 Technologies Used
C++ (STL - vector, string, fstream)

File Handling (tasks.txt for persistence)

ANSI Escape Codes for Styling (for colored text in console)
